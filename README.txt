Steps:
1. Create environment with conda (environment.yml file)
2. Activate this conda environment
3. Using pip, install the puncta_tracking package: pip install ./puncta_tracking-master.zip
4. Run track explorer by: panel serve app.py --show --dev

How to use the app.py file:
You need 3 files from the same movie for the track explorer:
1. pkl_file -> Path to the trackmate_tracks_dag.pkl file in the results folder
2. movie_path -> Path to the original movie (where intensities are taken from)
3. mask_path -> Path to the mask generated by ilastik (ilastik_mask.tiff)

See get_track_movie if you are unsure about how to extract bounding box based images from the tracks (this is a hint for the classifier).
